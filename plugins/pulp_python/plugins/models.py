    This class represents a Python package.

    Packages stored on PyPI have significantly more metadata associated with them, but we have
    chosen to keep this model minimal. Below is an explanation for why this was done.

    There are some overloaded terms that should be briefly discussed. We will be using the
    semantics of PEP 426. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0426/#id14

    Package - An individual, installable Python package. Uniqueness of a package is determined by
              the project name, target architecture, and Python version. Note that there may not be
              a target architecture in the case of architecture agnostic packages. A Python version
              is also optional if there are no requirements for a specific runtime version.
    Release - A snapshot of the project. A particular release of the project will all share the
              same version number, but there may be multiple packages for a given release for
              different architectures, Python versions, and package types.
    Project - The entire group of packages of all releases.

    The way that PyPI stores the metadata on their end leaves this model open to potential
    inaccuracies because they assume that all packages of the same project share certain metadata,
    including mutable fields. In the situation where a mutable field changes between releases, only
    the latest version is present in the metadata accessible over the API. This is could be
    particularly problematic for a field like "license". For this reason, most of these fields have
    been left out of this model. The only fields that are included here are necessary for sync
    (name, version, filename, path) or are useful for disambiguation between similarly named
    projects (author, summary). By keeping the scope of the metadata as small as is reasonable, we
    have less complexity and reduced risk of innacuracy.

    :ivar author: primary author of the package
    :type author: basestring
    :ivar filename: name of the file containing the package and metadata
    :type filename: basestring
    :ivar md5_digest: md5 checksum provided by PyPI to ensure we got the correct bits
    :type md5_digest: basestring
    :ivar name: name of the project, ex. scipy
    :type name: basestring
    :ivar packagetype: format of python package, ex bdist_wheel, sdist
    :type packagetype: basestring
    :ivar path: relative path to the bits for this package
    :type path: basestring
    :ivar summary: one line summary of what the package does
    :type summary: basestring
    :ivar version: Contains the distribution's version number. This field must be in the format
                   specified in PEP 386.
